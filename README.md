# Project Name: Donation and Charity Management System

This repository contains a full-stack application with a backend and a frontend. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally starting from a zip file.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (optional, if you want to clone the repository later)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Extract the ZIP File
1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file containing the project.
2. Right-click the file and select **Extract All...** or use a tool like `unzip` if on a terminal.
3. After extraction, you should have a folder named `Donation and Charity Management System` with the following structure:

```
Donation and Charity Management System/
├── backend/
│   ├── node_modules/
│   ├── uploads/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── package.json
│   └── server.js
├── frontend/my-frontend/
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── public/
    ├── src/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── eslint.config.js
    ├── index.html
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    ├── tsconfig.app.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── tsconfig.node.json
    └── vite.config.ts
```

### 2. Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd Donation and Charity Management System/backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   - Open the `.env` file located in the backend folder.
   - Update the values as needed (e.g., database connection string, API keys, etc.). If the file is missing, contact the project maintainer for the correct `.env` file.

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the `.env` file).

### 3. Setting Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd Donation and Charity Management System/frontend/my-frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the frontend server, and it should provide a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) where the application can be accessed.

---

### 4. Testing the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL provided by the development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2. Interact with the application, ensuring that the frontend communicates correctly with the backend.

---

## Additional Notes

- If there are issues with port conflicts, update the port numbers in the backend `.env` file or the frontend configuration (`vite.config.ts`).
- Use the `uploads/` folder in the backend for any file-related operations. Ensure the folder has proper read/write permissions.
- For production deployment, build the frontend and configure the backend to serve the static files from the `dist/` folder.
  
---

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend Errors**: Check the terminal for error logs and ensure the `.env` file is properly configured.
- **Frontend Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and check the browser console for debugging information.
- **General Issues**: Delete the `node_modules` folders and `package-lock.json` files, then re-run `npm install` in both the backend and frontend directories.
